# Data Project
This is a learning experience
- As part of code training in python we were given three different sources of data and were asked to exctract, clean and analyze it, and to produce some reports adapted to the user
- The aim was to practice our skills in factoring and pipeline programming
- The three data sources were: a sqlite database file, an API and a web
- If you are an experienced programmer you might watch this code and feel nostalgic about the early days of your coding journey and the sometimes too complex too long ways to go solve a tiny problem
- If you are a beginner, we would like to share with you the concept of MVP (minimum viable project), that puts the focus of any programing effort in the real delivery of a product.
